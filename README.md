# Hammett Plot Data Analysis and Visualization Tool
This project leverages a model to analyze chemistry-related papers and generate answers to specified questions based on the paper's content.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to facilitate the analysis of chemistry-related literature. Users can provide specified papers, questions and data, the program will generate answers by comprehensively reading and analyzing the paper.

## Key features include:

- Generating Hammett plot graphs based on user-selected substituents.
- Downloading graph data for further analysis.
- Using the downloaded data in conjunction with the paper and specified question for detailed analysis and insight generation.
